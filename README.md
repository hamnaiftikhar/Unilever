# Unilever Internship 2023

During my Unilever internship, I was assigned the task of modernizing their manual inventory system. This involved transforming the way they tracked things, including the SL900 machine used in Magnum production. I needed to digitally store various details such as descriptions, parts, quantities, and costs. To accomplish this, I utilized SQL and a tool known as phpMyAdmin. I integrated the database with the website using PHP, and the entire system operates on a specialized server called XAMPP on my computer. This project also entails creating a website to manage all inventory using tools like JavaScript, PHP, HTML5, and CSS. This website acts like a digital shopping list, aiding Unilever in maintaining a well-organized record-keeping system.

right now im working on it. Complete code and code will be updated soon.
